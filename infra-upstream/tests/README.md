# AI Landing Zone — Test harness

> Scope: deterministic offline contract checks plus the issue #58 (v2.0.0)
> live integration harness.

This directory contains offline checks used by CI and a purpose-built
hub-and-spoke fixture for validating v2.0.0 deliverables end-to-end against a
real Azure subscription. The live fixture is **not** required to use the landing
zone; it exists to reproduce the two synthetic scenarios in issue #58.

## Conventions

| Concept | Convention |
|---|---|
| Test subscription | `9788a92c-2f71-4629-8173-7ad449cb50e1` |
| Hub resource group | `rg-ailz-hub` (singleton; reused across tests) |
| Spoke resource group | `rg-ailz-spoke-MMDDYYHHMM` (timestamp; one per `azd provision` run) |
| Hub location | `eastus2` |
| Hub address space | `10.100.0.0/16` (non-overlapping with default spoke `192.168.0.0/21`) |
| Cleanup | Manual — operator inspects and deletes RGs explicitly. Hub is intentionally long-lived to avoid 30-minute re-provision delays |

## Offline contract checks

Run from the repository root:

```pwsh
pwsh tests/contracts/Test-HostedAgentContract.ps1
pwsh tests/contracts/Test-AcrTaskAgentPoolFirewallContract.ps1
pwsh tests/scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.Tests.ps1
```

The hosted-agent contract test compiles with the Bicep version recorded in its
fixture and proves that the default-disabled feature preserves every symbolic
resource from the merge base. It permits changes only in the two centralized
RBAC deployment payloads and checks that those additions are
`deployHostedAgent`-gated, least privilege, and accompanied by the stable
Foundry/registry handoff. The ACR Task agent pool firewall contract test
(Azure/GPT-RAG#597) asserts that the VNet-injected ACR Tasks dedicated agent
pool's required outbound platform-bootstrap Network Rules (AzureKeyVault,
Storage, EventHub, AzureActiveDirectory, AzureMonitor) are present, correctly
gated, ordered, and scoped to the devops build agents subnet — independent of
the opaque hash check above. The deterministic preflight tests cover disabled,
valid, mutable-image, and missing-prerequisite configurations without accessing
Azure.

## End-to-end test flow

### 1. Deploy the hub (one time per subscription)

```pwsh
pwsh tests/scripts/Deploy-Hub.ps1
```

This:
- Switches `az` to the test subscription if needed.
- Creates `rg-ailz-hub` if missing.
- Deploys `tests/hub/main.bicep` — VNet + Firewall (Standard) + Bastion (Standard) + LAW.
- Writes outputs to `tests/hub/.outputs.json`.

Takes ~25-30 minutes (Azure Firewall + Bastion provisioning).

To preview without applying:

```pwsh
pwsh tests/scripts/Deploy-Hub.ps1 -WhatIf
```

### 2. Deploy the spoke (per test)

The spoke is the landing zone itself (`main.bicep` at repo root). You drive
it via `azd`, passing parameters captured from the hub:

```pwsh
# Pick a fresh spoke RG name following the convention
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format 'MMddyyHHmm'
$spokeRG = "rg-ailz-spoke-$timestamp"

# Load hub outputs
$hub = Get-Content tests/hub/.outputs.json | ConvertFrom-Json

# Create azd env and inject hub references
azd env new "ailz-v2-$timestamp"
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 9788a92c-2f71-4629-8173-7ad449cb50e1
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP $spokeRG
azd env set NETWORK_ISOLATION true
azd env set HUB_VNET_RESOURCE_ID $hub.hubVnetResourceId
azd env set CREATE_HUB_PEERING true
azd env set EGRESS_NEXT_HOP_IP $hub.firewallPrivateIp                  # Gap 6 (optional)
azd env set LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE_RESOURCE_ID $hub.logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId  # Gap 5 (optional)
azd env set DEPLOY_BASTION false                                       # Use hub Bastion instead

# Provision
azd provision
```

> **Note:** the specific `azd env` keys above (HUB_VNET_RESOURCE_ID,
> CREATE_HUB_PEERING, etc.) are introduced by v2.0.0 Gaps 6/7/4. Until the
> corresponding gap commit lands, those env vars will be silently ignored by the
> spoke deployment.

### 3. Connect to the spoke jumpbox via the hub Bastion

After provision completes, locate the jumpbox VM in the spoke RG and connect
through Azure Portal:

1. Azure Portal → Resource Groups → `rg-ailz-hub` → Bastion host
2. Connect to the spoke jumpbox VM by resource ID (paste `/subscriptions/9788a92c-.../resourceGroups/<spokeRG>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vmName>`).
3. Authenticate with the credentials set via `azd env set AZURE_JUMPBOX_PASSWORD` (the standard landing-zone parameter).

Once logged in, post-provision scripts and validation run **from inside the
jumpbox**.

### 4. Verify the Container App from the jumpbox

Inside the jumpbox session:

```pwsh
# Get the Container App FQDN (output by the spoke deployment)
$caFqdn = azd env get-value APP_CONTAINER_APP_ORCHESTRATOR_FQDN

# Hit it from the jumpbox (which sits inside the spoke VNet and can reach
# the Container App private FQDN through the VNet-linked Private DNS zone)
Invoke-WebRequest "https://$caFqdn" -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object StatusCode, Content
```

Expected: HTTP 200 + the dotnet/samples:aspnetapp-9.0 default landing page
(which is the v2.0.0 dummy image listening on port 8080).

## What the test fixture intentionally does NOT do

- The hub firewall has an **empty policy**. Spoke egress is not forced through
  it by default. To exercise Gap 6 end-to-end with active filtering, populate
  `firewallPolicy.properties.ruleCollectionGroups` (out of scope for the
  v2.0.0 acceptance test). See plan.md §4.6 Option B.
- The hub has **no Private DNS zones**. The spoke creates its own (default) or
  reuses external zones declared via `existingPrivateDnsZones` (Gap 2). No
  central DNS resolver is configured.
- Bidirectional VNet peering: the **spoke→hub** peering is created by the
  spoke deployment itself (Gap 7). The **hub→spoke** reverse peering must be
  added separately — the hub deploy script does not know spoke VNet IDs
  in advance. Use:

  ```pwsh
  az network vnet peering create `
    --name to-spoke-<timestamp> `
    --resource-group rg-ailz-hub `
    --vnet-name $hub.hubVnetName `
    --remote-vnet $spokeVnetId `
    --allow-vnet-access true
  ```

  This is captured in `tests/scripts/Add-HubToSpokePeering.ps1` (Phase 7 add).
